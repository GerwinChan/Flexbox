        <p> Martijn Gerard Garritsen, better known by his stage name Martin Garrix (stylized Mar+in Garri×), is a Dutch DJ, record producer and musician. He is currently ranked number 3 on DJ Mag. He founded and owns the record label STMPD RCRDS.</p>
        
        <p>Martin Garrix learned to play guitar at age 8. In 2004, Martin Garrix expressed interest in becoming a DJ after seeing Tiësto perform at the Olympic games in Athens. Garritsen took particular inspiration from the track "Traffic", prompting him to download specialist software, FL Studio, and enabling him to start composing. In 2013, Garritsen graduated from the Herman Brood Academy, a production school in Utrecht. He ghost writes tracks for other artists, and despite this, only one in fifty of his tracks have made it out to the public.</p>
